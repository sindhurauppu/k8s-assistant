Immutable infrastructure involves deploying infrastructure components, such as virtual machines or containers, that cannot be altered once they are deployed. Instead of making changes directly to running systems, updates are implemented by deploying new versions.

Infrastructure as code complements immutable infrastructure by allowing all the automation necessary to create and manage this immutable infrastructure to be stored in version control systems like Git. This approach means that any changes to the infrastructure are documented as code, providing a clear and traceable audit log of changes, enhancing accountability and reducing the risk of unauthorized changes.

"The main problem with using a simple hash-based scheme for assigning requests to queues is that any high-intensity flow will crowd out all the low-intensity flows that hash to the same queue. Providing good insulation for a large number of flows requires a large number of queues, which is problematic.","A technique for assigning requests to queues that provides better isolation than hashing modulo the number of queues.

<!--more--> 

We are often concerned with insulating different flows of requests
from each other, so that a high-intensity flow does not crowd out low-intensity flows.
A simple way to put requests into queues is to hash some
characteristics of the request, modulo the number of queues, to get
the index of the queue to use. The hash function uses as input
characteristics of the request that align with flows. For example, in
the Internet this is often the 5-tuple of source and destination
address, protocol, and source and destination port.

That simple hash-based scheme has the property that any high-intensity flow
will crowd out all the low-intensity flows that hash to the same queue.
Providing good insulation for a large number of flows requires a large
number of queues, which is problematic. Shuffle-sharding is a more
nimble technique that can do a better job of insulating the low-intensity
flows from the high-intensity flows. The terminology of shuffle-sharding uses
the metaphor of dealing a hand from a deck of cards; each queue is a
metaphorical card. The shuffle-sharding technique starts with hashing
the flow-identifying characteristics of the request, to produce a hash
value with dozens or more of bits. Then the hash value is used as a
source of entropy to shuffle the deck and deal a hand of cards
(queues). All the dealt queues are examined, and the request is put
into one of the examined queues with the shortest length. With a
modest hand size, it does not cost much to examine all the dealt cards
and a given low-intensity flow has a good chance to dodge the effects of a
given high-intensity flow. With a large hand size it is expensive to examine
the dealt queues and more difficult for the low-intensity flows to dodge the
collective effects of a set of high-intensity flows. Thus, the hand size
should be chosen judiciously.",f206f583,What is the main problem with using a simple hash-based scheme for assigning requests to queues?,Shuffle-sharding,0.8924348
"Shuffle-sharding improves insulation between low-intensity and high-intensity request flows by using a more sophisticated method than simple hashing. Instead of placing requests into queues based directly on a hash value, shuffle-sharding involves hashing the flow-identifying characteristics of a request to produce a hash value with many bits. This hash value is then used as a source of entropy to shuffle and deal a subset of available queues (referred to as a ""hand"" of cards).

The request is examined across all the dealt queues, and it is placed into the queue with the shortest length. This approach allows low-intensity flows to have a higher chance of avoiding the queues that high-intensity flows are using, as not all requests are forced into the same queue based solely on a modulo operation. The hand size is an important factor: a modest hand size ensures low-intensity flows can avoid high-intensity flows without excessive overhead, whereas a large hand size might make it harder for low-intensity flows to dodge high-intensity flows due to increased examination cost.","A technique for assigning requests to queues that provides better isolation than hashing modulo the number of queues.

"Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) differ mainly in the level of management provided by the cloud provider:

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** With IaaS, the cloud provider is responsible for the underlying infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking. You, as the user, manage everything built on top of that infrastructure, such as operating systems and applications. IaaS typically involves more control over the IT resources compared to PaaS.

- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** In a PaaS offering, the cloud provider manages not only the infrastructure but also the Kubernetes control plane and the related services such as networking and storage. This reduces the level of control and management you need to perform, allowing you to focus more on application development rather than infrastructure maintenance.

Kubernetes manages the allocation of resources to workloads and utilizes operating system primitives to manage consumption, ensuring that containerized applications run efficiently and effectively.",,31d109d1,What is the main purpose of Kubernetes in the context of containerized applications?,Glossary,0.7342349
"To ensure that containerized applications are deployed and managed consistently across different environments, Kubernetes uses several key components and concepts:

1. **Replicas**: Kubernetes uses replicas to ensure high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance by maintaining multiple identical instances of a pod. By defining the number of replicas in a Deployment or ReplicaSet, Kubernetes ensures that the specified number of instances are running, automatically adjusting the count as needed. This contributes to efficient load balancing, rolling updates, and self-healing capabilities.

2. **Kubelet**: The kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It takes a set of PodSpecs, provided through various mechanisms, and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy. The kubelet's role is to ensure the correct pods are running on the node and does not manage containers not created by Kubernetes, thus maintaining consistency.

3. **StatefulSet**: For applications that require persistent identity and storage, Kubernetes uses StatefulSets. StatefulSets manage the deployment and scaling of a set of pods, providing guarantees about ordering and uniqueness. This is especially useful for stateful applications where pods aren't interchangeable.

These mechanisms allow Kubernetes to abstract the underlying infrastructure and provide a consistent environment for deploying and managing containerized applications across different environments.",,31d109d1,How does Kubernetes ensure that containerized applications are deployed and managed consistently across different environments?,Glossary,0.78098106

"Kubernetes offers several benefits for managing microservices architectures:

- **Scalability**: Kubernetes allows you to easily scale microservices horizontally by adjusting the number of replicas for a given service, ensuring the system can handle varying loads efficiently.

- **High Availability**: Through replication and self-healing, Kubernetes ensures that microservices are highly available, automatically restarting failed instances and distributing them across available nodes to minimize downtime.

- **Fault Tolerance**: By using multiple replicas and distributing them across nodes, Kubernetes can provide fault tolerance, maintaining service availability even when some instances fail.

- **Automated Deployments and Rollbacks**: Kubernetes supports automated deployments with zero downtime and can roll back changes swiftly if issues are detected, making it easier to manage microservices.

- **Resource Optimization**: Kubernetes provides resource management capabilities to allocate CPU, memory, and other resources effectively among microservices, ensuring optimal performance.

- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: Kubernetes simplifies service discovery and includes built-in load balancing, enabling microservices to discover each other and distribute traffic efficiently.

- **Consistency and Declarative Configuration**: With Kubernetes, you can define the desired state of your microservices using configuration files, ensuring consistency across environments and simplifying management.

"In Kubernetes, affinity and anti-affinity specifications influence the scheduling of pods by providing the scheduler with a set of rules that indicate how pods should be placed in relation to each other or to specific nodes. These rules can be classified into two types: node affinity and pod-to-pod affinity.

Node affinity involves rules related to the scheduling of pods on nodes based on node labels, allowing you to specify that a pod should be placed on nodes with specific labels. Pod-to-pod affinity and anti-affinity, on the other hand, allow you to define rules concerning the co-location of pods. These rules determine whether certain pods should be scheduled together (affinity) or apart (anti-affinity).

The rules can be either required or preferred, depending on how strictly you want the scheduler to enforce them. By using these specifications, you can optimize your workload placement for performance, resource usage, and availability.","Control plane component that watches for newly created

"Static provisioning in Kubernetes storage involves creating PersistentVolumes (PVs) ahead of time. Cluster administrators pre-configure these PVs, and they remain available for use by Pods. This approach requires the storage to be set up in advance, and it is generally used when the specific requirements are known beforehand.

Dynamic provisioning, on the other hand, eliminates the need for pre-provisioning. It automatically provisions storage upon user request. With dynamic provisioning, users submit PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) which trigger the automatic creation of PVs based on predefined StorageClass configurations. This method is more flexible and efficient for scenarios where on-demand storage is needed, as it allows storage to be created dynamically without manual intervention by administrators.","An API object that represents a piece of storage in the cluster.

```bash

"Annotations in Kubernetes are key-value pairs used to attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to objects. The metadata in an annotation can be small or large, structured or unstructured, and can include characters not permitted by labels. Unlike labels, which are used to identify and organize objects, annotations are generally used by tools and system extensions for storing additional data with objects, such as structured JSON.

Labels, in contrast, are key-value pairs used to identify and organize objects. They serve as an effective way to specify the selection criteria for queries and are instrumental in defining service selectors, replication controller queries, and other operations that depend on grouping resources logically. Labels have specific naming requirements and constraints, such as the ability to begin with a DNS subdomain prefix.","Update the annotations on one or more resources.

 All Kubernetes objects support the ability to store additional data with the object as annotations. Annotations are key/value pairs that can be larger than labels and include arbitrary string values such as structured JSON. Tools and system extensions may use annotations to store their own data.

 Attempting to set an annotation that already exists will fail unless --overwrite is set. If --resource-version is specified and does not match the current resource version on the server the command will fail.

The default editor used for editing resources if the KUBE_EDITOR or EDITOR environment variables are not set is 'vi' for Linux or 'notepad' for Windows.,"Edit a resource from the default editor.

 The edit command allows you to directly edit any API resource you can retrieve via the command-line tools. It will open the editor defined by your KUBE_EDITOR, or EDITOR environment variables, or fall back to 'vi' for Linux or 'notepad' for Windows. When attempting to open the editor, it will first attempt to use the shell that has been defined in the 'SHELL' environment variable. If this is not defined, the default shell will be used, which is '/bin/bash' for Linux or 'cmd' for Windows.

 You can edit multiple objects, although changes are applied one at a time. The command accepts file names as well as command-line arguments, although the files you point to must be previously saved versions of resources.

 Editing is done with the API version used to fetch the resource. To edit using a specific API version, fully-qualify the resource, version, and group.

 The default format is YAML. To edit in JSON, specify ""-o json"".

 The flag --windows-line-endings can be used to force Windows line endings, otherwise the default for your operating system will be used.

 In the event an error occurs while updating, a temporary file will be created on disk that contains your unapplied changes. The most common error when updating a resource is another editor changing the resource on the server. When this occurs, you will have to apply your changes to the newer version of the resource, or update your temporary saved copy to include the latest resource version.

"Context:
title: kubectl exec
answer: 
`kubectl exec` allows you to execute commands in a container in a pod. You can use it to run commands inside a pod's container for debugging purposes or to check the state of an application running in the pod.

The `-c` option is used to specify the name of the container to execute the command in if the pod has multiple containers. This is necessary when you have multiple containers running in a single pod, and you want to target a specific one for the command execution.

In contrast, if the pod has only one container, you don't need to specify the container name.

kubectl exec example Usage:
```bash
kubectl exec <pod-name> -c <container-name> -- <command>
```
The above command will execute a specified command inside the specified container of a running pod. If you omit the `-c <container-name>`, the command is executed in the one and only container if the pod has a single container.","Execute a command in a container.

"When deleting resources in Kubernetes, you can specify the following different arguments:

- File names
- Standard input (stdin)
- Resource types and names
- Resources and label selectors

Here are some examples of deletion commands:

```bash
# Delete a resource using a configuration file
kubectl delete -f FILENAME.yaml

# Delete resources from a directory with kustomization.yaml
kubectl delete -k DIRECTORY

# Delete all resources of a specific type
kubectl delete TYPE --all 

# Delete specific resources by type and name

Remember, only one type of argument can be specified for each delete command.","Delete resources by file names, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector.

 JSON and YAML formats are accepted. Only one type of argument may be specified: file names, resources and names, or resources and label selector.

 Some resources, such as pods, support graceful deletion. These resources define a default period before they are forcibly terminated (the grace period) but you may override that value with the --grace-period flag, or pass --now to set a grace-period of 1. Because these resources often represent entities in the cluster, deletion may not be acknowledged immediately. If the node hosting a pod is down or cannot reach the API server, termination may take significantly longer than the grace period. To force delete a resource, you must specify the --force flag. Note: only a subset of resources support graceful deletion. In absence of the support, the --grace-period flag is ignored.

 IMPORTANT: Force deleting pods does not wait for confirmation that the pod's processes have been terminated, which can leave those processes running until the node detects the deletion and completes graceful deletion. If your processes use shared storage or talk to a remote API and depend on the name of the pod to identify themselves, force deleting those pods may result in multiple processes running on different machines using the same identification which may lead to data corruption or inconsistency. Only force delete pods when you are sure the pod is terminated, or if your application can tolerate multiple copies of the same pod running at once. Also, if you force delete pods, the scheduler may place new pods on those nodes before the node has released those resources and causing those pods to be evicted immediately.

 Note that the delete command does NOT do resource version checks, so if someone submits an update to a resource right when you submit a delete, their update will be lost along with the rest of the resource.

 After a CustomResourceDefinition is deleted, invalidation of discovery cache may take up to 6 hours. If you don't want to wait, you might want to run ""kubectl api-resources"" to refresh the discovery cache.

Therefore, you should only force delete pods when you are certain that the pod is terminated, or if your application can tolerate multiple copies of the same pod running at once.","Delete resources by file names, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector.

 JSON and YAML formats are accepted. Only one type of argument may be specified: file names, resources and names, or resources and label selector.

 Some resources, such as pods, support graceful deletion. These resources define a default period before they are forcibly terminated (the grace period) but you may override that value with the --grace-period flag, or pass --now to set a grace-period of 1. Because these resources often represent entities in the cluster, deletion may not be acknowledged immediately. If the node hosting a pod is down or cannot reach the API server, termination may take significantly longer than the grace period. To force delete a resource, you must specify the --force flag. Note: only a subset of resources support graceful deletion. In absence of the support, the --grace-period flag is ignored.

 IMPORTANT: Force deleting pods does not wait for confirmation that the pod's processes have been terminated, which can leave those processes running until the node detects the deletion and completes graceful deletion. If your processes use shared storage or talk to a remote API and depend on the name of the pod to identify themselves, force deleting those pods may result in multiple processes running on different machines using the same identification which may lead to data corruption or inconsistency. Only force delete pods when you are sure the pod is terminated, or if your application can tolerate multiple copies of the same pod running at once. Also, if you force delete pods, the scheduler may place new pods on those nodes before the node has released those resources and causing those pods to be evicted immediately.

 Note that the delete command does NOT do resource version checks, so if someone submits an update to a resource right when you submit a delete, their update will be lost along with the rest of the resource.

 After a CustomResourceDefinition is deleted, invalidation of discovery cache may take up to 6 hours. If you don't want to wait, you might want to run ""kubectl api-resources"" to refresh the discovery cache.

 This command provides a view of recent resource consumption for nodes and pods. It fetches metrics from the Metrics Server, which aggregates this data from the kubelet on each node. The Metrics Server must be installed and running in the cluster for this command to work.

 The metrics shown are specifically optimized for Kubernetes autoscaling decisions, such as those made by the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA). Because of this, the values may not match those from standard OS tools like 'top', as the metrics are designed to provide a stable signal for autoscalers rather than for pinpoint accuracy.

 When to use this command:

  *  For on-the-fly spot-checks of resource usage (e.g. identify which pods are consuming the most resources at a glance, or get a quick sense of the load on your nodes)
  *  Understand current resource consumption patterns
  *  Validate the behavior of your HPA or VPA configurations by seeing the metrics they use for scaling decisions.

 It is not intended to be a replacement for full-featured monitoring solutions. Its primary design goal is to provide a low-overhead signal for autoscalers, not to be a perfectly accurate monitoring tool. For high-accuracy reporting, historical analysis, dashboarding, or alerting, you should use a dedicated monitoring solution.

"The `--prune` flag is used to apply configurations such that it deletes resources that are not defined in the configuration files. It is particularly used to manage and clean up resources by ensuring that only the resources defined in the files are present in the cluster.

Caution advised: The `--prune` functionality is still in Alpha and not yet complete. It should be used only if you are aware of the current limitations and behaviors.","Apply a configuration to a resource by file name or stdin. The resource name must be specified. This resource will be created if it doesn't exist yet. To use 'apply', always create the resource initially with either 'apply' or 'create --save-config'.

 JSON and YAML formats are accepted.

 Alpha Disclaimer: the --prune functionality is not yet complete. Do not use unless you are aware of what the current state is. See https://issues.k8s.io/34274.
