"To scale a Kubernetes cluster by adding resources, you can deploy new Nodes to the cluster. This is part of cluster operations, which involves scaling the cluster as one of its tasks. By adding more Nodes, you increase the cluster's capacity to run more workloads.

For managing deployment scaling, you can use the `kubectl scale` command to adjust the number of replicas for a deployment, replica set, replication controller, or stateful set. Here are some examples:

```bash
# Scale a replica set named 'foo' to 3
kubectl scale --replicas=3 rs/foo

# Scale a resource identified by type and name specified in ""foo.yaml"" to 3
kubectl scale --replicas=3 -f foo.yaml

# If the deployment named mysql's current size is 2, scale mysql to 3
kubectl scale --current-replicas=2 --replicas=3 deployment/mysql

# Scale multiple replication controllers
kubectl scale --replicas=5 rc/example1 rc/example2 rc/example3

# Scale stateful set named 'web' to 3
kubectl scale --replicas=3 statefulset/web
```

"Immutable Infrastructure refers to computer infrastructure that cannot be changed once deployed. Immutability can be enforced by an automated process that overwrites unauthorized changes or through a system that won’t allow changes in the first place. Docker containers are a good example of immutable infrastructure because persistent changes to containers can only be made by creating a new version of the container or recreating the existing container from its image. By preventing or identifying unauthorized changes, immutable infrastructures make it easier to identify and mitigate security risks. Operating such a system becomes more straightforward because administrators can make assumptions about it, as they know no mistakes or changes were made without communication.

"Immutable infrastructure helps in identifying and mitigating security risks by preventing or identifying unauthorized changes. Since the infrastructure cannot be altered once deployed, any deviation from the expected state is immediately noticed. This reduces the likelihood of undetected configuration errors, vulnerabilities, or malware being introduced over time. Moreover, because immutable infrastructure relies on creating new versions or instances for changes, it ensures a consistent and secure state with each deployment. This approach makes it easier for administrators to manage and assume the security posture of the system.

Additionally, when paired with infrastructure as code stored in version control, it provides a durable audit log of every authorized change, enabling traceability and accountability, which further aids in security management.","Immutable Infrastructure refers to computer infrastructure (virtual machines, containers, network appliances) that cannot be changed once deployed.

<!--more-->
It is sometimes useful for a container to have information about itself, without
needing to make changes to the container code that directly couple it to Kubernetes.

The Kubernetes downward API allows containers to consume information about themselves
or their context in a Kubernetes cluster. Applications in containers can have
access to that information, without the application needing to act as a client of
the Kubernetes API.

There are two ways to expose Pod and container fields to a running container:

- using [environment variables](/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/)
- using [a `downwardAPI` volume](/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/)

"The main problem with using a simple hash-based scheme for assigning requests to queues is that any high-intensity flow will crowd out all the low-intensity flows that hash to the same queue. This scheme requires a large number of queues to provide good insulation for a large number of flows, which can be problematic.","A technique for assigning requests to queues that provides better isolation than hashing modulo the number of queues.

<!--more--> 

We are often concerned with insulating different flows of requests
from each other, so that a high-intensity flow does not crowd out low-intensity flows.
A simple way to put requests into queues is to hash some
characteristics of the request, modulo the number of queues, to get
the index of the queue to use. The hash function uses as input
characteristics of the request that align with flows. For example, in
the Internet this is often the 5-tuple of source and destination
address, protocol, and source and destination port.

That simple hash-based scheme has the property that any high-intensity flow
will crowd out all the low-intensity flows that hash to the same queue.
Providing good insulation for a large number of flows requires a large
number of queues, which is problematic. Shuffle-sharding is a more
nimble technique that can do a better job of insulating the low-intensity
flows from the high-intensity flows. The terminology of shuffle-sharding uses
the metaphor of dealing a hand from a deck of cards; each queue is a
metaphorical card. The shuffle-sharding technique starts with hashing
the flow-identifying characteristics of the request, to produce a hash
value with dozens or more of bits. Then the hash value is used as a
source of entropy to shuffle the deck and deal a hand of cards
(queues). All the dealt queues are examined, and the request is put
into one of the examined queues with the shortest length. With a
modest hand size, it does not cost much to examine all the dealt cards
and a given low-intensity flow has a good chance to dodge the effects of a
given high-intensity flow. With a large hand size it is expensive to examine
the dealt queues and more difficult for the low-intensity flows to dodge the
collective effects of a set of high-intensity flows. Thus, the hand size
should be chosen judiciously.",f206f583,What is the main problem with using a simple hash-based scheme for assigning requests to queues?,Shuffle-sharding
"Shuffle-sharding improves insulation between low-intensity and high-intensity request flows by using a more sophisticated technique than simple hashing. Instead of assigning requests to queues based on a hash modulo operation, shuffle-sharding uses a hash value as a source of entropy to shuffle a metaphorical deck of queues (like dealing a hand of cards) and then selects a queue from the dealt hand with the shortest length. This allows low-intensity flows a better chance to avoid being crowded out by high-intensity flows, as they are not confined to a single queue.

"The main purpose of Kubernetes in the context of containerized applications is to manage the deployment, scaling, and operation of these applications. Kubernetes provides an abstraction layer over the underlying host infrastructure, automating the orchestration of containerized applications across clusters of machines, ensuring efficient resource utilization, and managing the lifecycle of containers. This makes it easier to deploy applications consistently across different environments and to scale them according to demand.",,31d109d1,What is the main purpose of Kubernetes in the context of containerized applications?,Glossary
"To ensure that containerized applications are deployed and managed consistently across different environments, Kubernetes employs several key mechanisms:

- **Replicas**: Kubernetes maintains multiple identical instances of a pod to ensure high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance. By defining the number of replicas in a Deployment or ReplicaSet, Kubernetes automatically adjusts the count of running instances as needed.

- **Kubelet**: This agent runs on each node in the cluster to ensure that containers are running according to the provided PodSpecs. It manages the lifecycle of pods and checks the health of containers.

- **StatefulSets**: These manage the deployment and scaling of pods, providing guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of the pods. StatefulSets maintain a sticky identity for each pod, making it easier to handle persistent storage across pod reschedules.

- **Resource Management**: Kubernetes abstracts resources such as CPU, memory, and GPUs for allocation to workloads, ensuring efficient distribution and utilization across the cluster. It uses dynamic resource allocation for managing complex allocations automatically.

These systems work together to provide consistent, reliable application deployment and management across various environments.",,31d109d1,How does Kubernetes ensure that containerized applications are deployed and managed consistently across different environments?,Glossary
"Kubernetes objects play a crucial role in the management of an application's lifecycle as they represent the desired state of the cluster. When you create a Kubernetes object, you are essentially declaring your intent for a specific part of your workload. The Kubernetes system constantly works to ensure that the actual state of the cluster matches this desired state, thus managing the application's lifecycle automatically. This declarative approach allows Kubernetes to manage applications efficiently by ensuring they run as intended, handling tasks like load balancing, scaling, and self-healing.",,31d109d1,What role do Kubernetes objects play in the management of an application's lifecycle?,Glossary
"Kubernetes handles scaling of applications through the use of replicas.

This replica management allows for workload scaling and distribution across multiple nodes in a cluster, ensuring high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.",,31d109d1,How does Kubernetes handle scaling of applications to accommodate varying loads?,Glossary
"Kubernetes provides several benefits for managing microservices architectures:

- **Scalability:** Kubernetes enables dynamic scaling of applications to handle varying loads. It manages replicas of services, ensuring that the desired state of your application is achieved.

- **Resilience and Fault Tolerance:** By using replicas, Kubernetes ensures high availability. If a pod fails, Kubernetes automatically reschedules it on a healthy node, providing self-healing capabilities.

- **Load Balancing:** Kubernetes can distribute network traffic effectively between services, ensuring optimal resource utilization and higher performance for deployed applications.

- **Resource Management:** It abstracts the complex resource allocation to workloads using defined resources like CPU and memory, allowing for efficient resource consumption and dynamic management.

- **Automated Operations:** Kubernetes supports automated operations like rolling updates, scaling, and failover. This automation reduces manual intervention and potential errors.

- **Platform Agnosticism:** Kubernetes supports multiple cloud providers and on-premise environments, offering flexibility in deploying and managing applications across different infrastructures.

- **Service Discovery and Networking:** It uses DNS and service definitions to automatically discover services, simplifying communication management between microservices.

- `parameters`: This field allows specifying different parameters to be passed to the provisioner. These parameters can define various aspects of storage like performance, encryption, and other settings that are applicable to the storage being provisioned.

- `reclaimPolicy`: This field defines what should happen to the underlying storage resource when the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is deleted. The reclaim policy can be set to `Retain`, `Recycle`, or `Delete`:
  - `Retain`: The storage resource will be retained and not automatically deleted. Manual cleanup is required.

"Kubernetes handles scaling of applications by using replicas to ensure high availability and scalability. Replicas are copies of pods or sets of pods that provide fault tolerance by maintaining multiple identical instances. By defining the number of replicas in a Deployment or ReplicaSet, Kubernetes ensures that the specified number of instances are running, automatically adjusting the count as needed.

For scaling operations, you can use the `kubectl scale` command to set a new size for a deployment, replica set, replication controller, or stateful set. This command allows specifying preconditions for the scale action, such as `--current-replicas` or `--resource-version`, which are validated before scaling. Here are some examples:

```bash
# Scale a replica set named 'foo' to 3
kubectl scale --replicas=3 rs/foo

# Scale a resource identified by type and name specified in ""foo.yaml"" to 3
kubectl scale --replicas=3 -f foo.yaml

# If the deployment named mysql's current size is 2, scale mysql to 3
kubectl scale --current-replicas=2 --replicas=3 deployment/mysql

# Scale multiple replication controllers
kubectl scale --replicas=5 rc/example1 rc/example2 rc/example3

# Scale stateful set named 'web' to 3
kubectl scale --replicas=3 statefulset/web

"A Pod is the smallest and simplest Kubernetes object, representing a set of running containers on your cluster. It is typically set up to run a single primary container, with the option to include sidecar containers for supplementary features like logging.

A Node, on the other hand, is a worker machine within Kubernetes, which can be a virtual or physical machine. It contains local daemons and services necessary to run Pods and is managed by the control plane. The daemons include kubelet, kube-proxy, and a container runtime. In essence, a Pod runs within a Node in a Kubernetes cluster.",,96890108,How does a Kubernetes Pod differ from a Node?,Introduction to kubectl
"The API server is a component of the Kubernetes that exposes the Kubernetes API. It serves as the front end for the Kubernetes control plane. The main implementation of a Kubernetes API server is kube-apiserver, which is designed to scale horizontally by deploying more instances. You can run several instances of kube-apiserver and balance traffic between those instances.",,96890108,What role does the API server play in a Kubernetes cluster?,Introduction to kubectl
"To manage containerized applications, Kubernetes provides capabilities for high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance by ensuring multiple identical instances (replicas) of applications are maintained, automatically adjusting counts as needed. It allows for workload scaling, distribution across multiple nodes, efficient load balancing, rolling updates, and self-healing capabilities, ensuring the desired application state and reliability.",,8789a9d4,What is the primary purpose of Kubernetes in managing containerized applications?,Kubectl user preferences (kuberc)
"Kubernetes ensures high availability for applications primarily through the use of replicas. By defining the number of replicas in a Deployment or ReplicaSet, Kubernetes maintains multiple identical instances of a pod. This ensures high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance by distributing the workload across multiple nodes in a cluster.

"To scale applications automatically, Kubernetes uses replicas and other mechanisms like the Kubernetes API to manage resources dynamically. By defining the number of replicas in a Deployment or ReplicaSet, Kubernetes ensures availability and distribution of workloads, allowing for efficient scaling. Additionally, Kubernetes abstracts and manages resources like CPU and memory through its API, enabling dynamic resource allocation to adapt to workload demands.",,8789a9d4,What mechanisms does Kubernetes use to scale applications automatically?,Kubectl user preferences (kuberc)
"Kubernetes handles resource allocation for different applications using abstracted resources such as CPU, memory, and others for allocation to workloads. Kubernetes utilizes operating system primitives to manage consumption by these workloads.

Moreover, Kubernetes provides a feature called Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), which lets you request and share resources among Pods. With DRA, device drivers and cluster admins define device classes that can be claimed in workloads. Kubernetes then allocates matching devices to specific claims and places the corresponding Pods on nodes that can access the allocated devices.

In terms of managing how resources are distributed across nodes, Kubernetes offers affinity rules. These rules provide hints to the scheduler about where to place pods. There are two kinds of affinity: node affinity and pod-to-pod affinity, which can be either required or preferred, giving flexibility in how strictly the scheduler enforces them.

For the configuration of application resources, the `kubectl set` command is available to help make changes to existing resources.",,8789a9d4,How does Kubernetes handle resource allocation for different applications?,Kubectl user preferences (kuberc)
"A Kubernetes cluster consists of the following basic components:

1. **Control Plane Components**: 
   - **API Server**: The entry point for all administrative tasks. It exposes the Kubernetes API.
   - **etcd**: A consistent and highly-available key-value store used for all cluster data.
   - **Controller Manager**: Manages various controllers that regulate the state of the cluster.
   - **Scheduler**: Assigns workloads to nodes based on resource availability.

2. **Nodes**: 
   - These are the physical or virtual machines that run containerized applications.

3. **Container Runtime**: 
   - A software component like containerd or CRI-O that manages the lifecycle of containers on a node.

4. **kubelet**: 
   - An agent that runs on each node, ensuring that containers are running as expected.

5. **kube-proxy**: 
   - A networking component that enables communication between services and pods within a cluster.

6. **kubectl**:
   - A command-line interface to communicate with the cluster for administrative tasks.",,58e490dc,What are the basic components of a Kubernetes cluster?,kubectl reference
"To manage containerized applications across a cluster, Kubernetes uses a component called the ""kubelet."" The kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various mechanisms and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy. Additionally, Kubernetes utilizes controllers, which are control loops that watch the state of the cluster and make or request changes as needed to maintain the desired state of the applications. These controllers collectively ensure that the current cluster state is as close as possible to the desired state defined for the applications.",,58e490dc,How does Kubernetes manage containerized applications across a cluster?,kubectl reference
The API server is a component of the Kubernetes that exposes the Kubernetes API. It is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane and is designed to scale horizontally by deploying more instances. You can run several instances of kube-apiserver and balance traffic between those instances.,,58e490dc,What role does the Kubernetes API server play in the cluster architecture?,kubectl reference
"In Kubernetes, controllers are control loops that watch the state of your cluster, then make or request changes where needed. Each controller tries to move the current cluster state closer to the desired state. Controllers watch the shared state of your cluster through the API server (part of the control plane). Some controllers also run inside the control plane, providing control loops that are core to Kubernetes' operations. For example, the deployment controller, the daemonset controller, the namespace controller, and the persistent volume controller (and others) all run within the control plane.

Additionally, Kubernetes uses the concept of _affinity_ to give hints to the scheduler about where to place pods. Affinity consists of a set of rules that can be either required or preferred, depending on how strictly you want the scheduler to enforce them. There are two kinds of affinity: node affinity and pod-to-pod affinity.

Schedulers are responsible for making decisions about which nodes should run unscheduled pods based on resource availability, affinity rules, and other constraints. They play a critical role ensuring optimal placement of workloads within the cluster.",,58e490dc,Can you explain how Kubernetes uses controllers and schedulers?,kubectl reference

"Annotations in Kubernetes are key-value pairs used to attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to objects. This metadata can be small or large, structured or unstructured, and can include characters not permitted by labels. Clients such as tools and libraries can retrieve this metadata.

Annotations differ from labels in that labels are used to identify and select objects, whereas annotations are intended for non-identifying purposes. Thus, labels are often used for organizing and managing objects through selectors, while annotations are used to store additional metadata that is not used for object selection.","Update the annotations on one or more resources.

"To describe resources in Kubernetes using their name prefix or label selector, you can use the `kubectl describe` command with the appropriate options:

- To describe resources using a name prefix:

```bash
kubectl describe TYPE NAME_PREFIX

- To describe resources using a label selector:

```bash
kubectl describe TYPE -l label

For example:
- Describe all pods with a name prefix:

```bash

"For Linux, the default editor is 'vi', and for Windows, the default editor is 'notepad'.","Edit a resource from the default editor.

 The edit command allows you to directly edit any API resource you can retrieve via the command-line tools. It will open the editor defined by your KUBE_EDITOR, or EDITOR environment variables, or fall back to 'vi' for Linux or 'notepad' for Windows. When attempting to open the editor, it will first attempt to use the shell that has been defined in the 'SHELL' environment variable. If this is not defined, the default shell will be used, which is '/bin/bash' for Linux or 'cmd' for Windows.

 You can edit multiple objects, although changes are applied one at a time. The command accepts file names as well as command-line arguments, although the files you point to must be previously saved versions of resources.

 Editing is done with the API version used to fetch the resource. To edit using a specific API version, fully-qualify the resource, version, and group.

 The default format is YAML. To edit in JSON, specify ""-o json"".

 The flag --windows-line-endings can be used to force Windows line endings, otherwise the default for your operating system will be used.

 In the event an error occurs while updating, a temporary file will be created on disk that contains your unapplied changes. The most common error when updating a resource is another editor changing the resource on the server. When this occurs, you will have to apply your changes to the newer version of the resource, or update your temporary saved copy to include the latest resource version.

"When deleting resources in Kubernetes, you can specify the following arguments:

- **File names**: Use the `-f FILENAME` flag to delete resources by providing the path to filenames.
  
- **Kustomizations**: Use the `-k DIRECTORY` flag to delete resources from a directory containing a `kustomization.yaml` file.
  
- **Type and Name**: Specify the resource type and optionally the name to delete specific resources.
  
- **Label Selector**: Use the `-l label` flag to delete resources matching the specified label selector.
  
- **All Resources**: Use the `--all` flag to delete all resources of a specified type.

Resources can be deleted by providing one of these argument types at a time. Each approach provides flexibility in how you target resources for deletion.","Delete resources by file names, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector.

 JSON and YAML formats are accepted. Only one type of argument may be specified: file names, resources and names, or resources and label selector.

 Some resources, such as pods, support graceful deletion. These resources define a default period before they are forcibly terminated (the grace period) but you may override that value with the --grace-period flag, or pass --now to set a grace-period of 1. Because these resources often represent entities in the cluster, deletion may not be acknowledged immediately. If the node hosting a pod is down or cannot reach the API server, termination may take significantly longer than the grace period. To force delete a resource, you must specify the --force flag. Note: only a subset of resources support graceful deletion. In absence of the support, the --grace-period flag is ignored.

 IMPORTANT: Force deleting pods does not wait for confirmation that the pod's processes have been terminated, which can leave those processes running until the node detects the deletion and completes graceful deletion. If your processes use shared storage or talk to a remote API and depend on the name of the pod to identify themselves, force deleting those pods may result in multiple processes running on different machines using the same identification which may lead to data corruption or inconsistency. Only force delete pods when you are sure the pod is terminated, or if your application can tolerate multiple copies of the same pod running at once. Also, if you force delete pods, the scheduler may place new pods on those nodes before the node has released those resources and causing those pods to be evicted immediately.

 Note that the delete command does NOT do resource version checks, so if someone submits an update to a resource right when you submit a delete, their update will be lost along with the rest of the resource.

 After a CustomResourceDefinition is deleted, invalidation of discovery cache may take up to 6 hours. If you don't want to wait, you might want to run ""kubectl api-resources"" to refresh the discovery cache.

"To delete resources from a directory containing a kustomization.yaml file, use the following command:

```","Delete resources by file names, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector.

 JSON and YAML formats are accepted. Only one type of argument may be specified: file names, resources and names, or resources and label selector.

 Some resources, such as pods, support graceful deletion. These resources define a default period before they are forcibly terminated (the grace period) but you may override that value with the --grace-period flag, or pass --now to set a grace-period of 1. Because these resources often represent entities in the cluster, deletion may not be acknowledged immediately. If the node hosting a pod is down or cannot reach the API server, termination may take significantly longer than the grace period. To force delete a resource, you must specify the --force flag. Note: only a subset of resources support graceful deletion. In absence of the support, the --grace-period flag is ignored.

 IMPORTANT: Force deleting pods does not wait for confirmation that the pod's processes have been terminated, which can leave those processes running until the node detects the deletion and completes graceful deletion. If your processes use shared storage or talk to a remote API and depend on the name of the pod to identify themselves, force deleting those pods may result in multiple processes running on different machines using the same identification which may lead to data corruption or inconsistency. Only force delete pods when you are sure the pod is terminated, or if your application can tolerate multiple copies of the same pod running at once. Also, if you force delete pods, the scheduler may place new pods on those nodes before the node has released those resources and causing those pods to be evicted immediately.

 Note that the delete command does NOT do resource version checks, so if someone submits an update to a resource right when you submit a delete, their update will be lost along with the rest of the resource.

 After a CustomResourceDefinition is deleted, invalidation of discovery cache may take up to 6 hours. If you don't want to wait, you might want to run ""kubectl api-resources"" to refresh the discovery cache.
