The hash function uses as input\\ncharacteristics of the request that align with flows. For example, in\\nthe Internet this is often the 5-tuple of source and destination\\naddress, protocol, and source and destination port.\\n\\nThat simple hash-based scheme has the property that any high-intensity flow\\nwill crowd out all the low-intensity flows that hash to the same queue.\\nProviding good insulation for a large number of flows requires a large\\nnumber of queues, which is problematic. Shuffle-sharding is a more\\nnimble technique that can do a better job of insulating the low-intensity\\nflows from the high-intensity flows. The terminology of shuffle-sharding uses\\nthe metaphor of dealing a hand from a deck of cards; each queue is a\\nmetaphorical card. The shuffle-sharding technique starts with hashing\\nthe flow-identifying characteristics of the request, to produce a hash\\nvalue with dozens or more of bits. Then the hash value is used as a\\nsource of entropy to shuffle the deck and deal a hand of cards\\n(queues). All the dealt queues are examined, and the request is put\\ninto one of the examined queues with the shortest length. With a\\nmodest hand size, it does not cost much to examine all the dealt cards\\nand a given low-intensity flow has a good chance to dodge the effects of a\\ngiven high-intensity flow. With a large hand size it is expensive to examine\\nthe dealt queues and more difficult for the low-intensity flows to dodge the\\ncollective effects of a set of high-intensity flows.

It will open the editor defined by your KUBE_EDITOR, or EDITOR environment variables, or fall back to \\'vi\\' for Linux or \\'notepad\\' for Windows. When attempting to open the editor, it will first attempt to use the shell that has been defined in the \\'SHELL\\' environment variable. If this is not defined, the default shell will be used, which is \\'/bin/bash\\' for Linux or \\'cmd\\' for Windows.\\n\\n You can edit multiple objects, although changes are applied one at a time. The command accepts file names as well as command-line arguments, although the files you point to must be previously saved versions of resources.\\n\\n Editing is done with the API version used to fetch the resource. To edit using a specific API version, fully-qualify the resource, version, and group.\\n\\n The default format is YAML. To edit in JSON, specify \"-o json\".\\n\\n The flag --windows-line-endings can be used to force Windows line endings, otherwise the default for your operating system will be used.\\n\\n In the event an error occurs while updating, a temporary file will be created on disk that contains your unapplied changes. The most common error when updating a resource is another editor changing the resource on the server.

Only one type of argument may be specified: file names, resources and names, or resources and label selector.\\n\\n Some resources, such as pods, support graceful deletion. These resources define a default period before they are forcibly terminated (the grace period) but you may override that value with the --grace-period flag, or pass --now to set a grace-period of 1. Because these resources often represent entities in the cluster, deletion may not be acknowledged immediately. If the node hosting a pod is down or cannot reach the API server, termination may take significantly longer than the grace period. To force delete a resource, you must specify the --force flag. Note: only a subset of resources support graceful deletion. In absence of the support, the --grace-period flag is ignored.\\n\\n IMPORTANT: Force deleting pods does not wait for confirmation that the pod\\'s processes have been terminated, which can leave those processes running until the node detects the deletion and completes graceful deletion. If your processes use shared storage or talk to a remote API and depend on the name of the pod to identify themselves, force deleting those pods may result in multiple processes running on different machines using the same identification which may lead to data corruption or inconsistency. Only force delete pods when you are sure the pod is terminated, or if your application can tolerate multiple copies of the same pod running at once. Also, if you force delete pods, the scheduler may place new pods on those nodes before the node has released those resources and causing those pods to be evicted immediately.\\n\\n Note that the delete command does NOT do resource version checks, so if someone submits an update to a resource right when you submit a delete, their update will be lost along with the rest of the resource.\\n\\n After a CustomResourceDefinition is deleted, invalidation of discovery cache may take up to 6 hours. If you don\\'t want to wait, you might want to run \"kubectl api-resources\" to refresh the discovery cache.\\n\\n```\\nkubectl delete ([-f FILENAME] | [-k DIRECTORY] | TYPE [(NAME | -l label | --all)])\\n```\\n\\n```\\n  # Delete a pod using the type and name specified in pod.json\\n  kubectl delete -f ./pod.json\\n  \\n  # Delete resources from a directory containing kustomization.yaml - e.g. dir/kustomization.yaml\\n  kubectl delete -k dir\\n  \\n  # Delete resources from all files that end with \\'.json\\'\\n  kubectl delete -f \\'*.json\\'\\n  \\n  # Delete a pod based on the type and name in the JSON passed into stdin\\n  cat pod.json | kubectl delete -f -\\n  \\n  # Delete pods and services with same names \"baz\" and \"foo\"\\n  kubectl delete pod,service baz foo\\n  \\n  # Delete pods and services with label name=myLabel\\n  kubectl delete pods,services -l name=myLabel\\n  \\n  # Delete a pod with minimal delay\\n  kubectl delete pod foo --now\\n  \\n  # Force delete a pod on a dead node\\n  kubectl delete pod foo --force\\n  \\n  # Delete all pods\\n  kubectl delete pods --all\\n  \\n  # Delete all pods only if the user confirms the deletion\\n  kubectl delete pods --all --interactive\\n```',\n",
